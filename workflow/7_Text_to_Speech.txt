I passed the following prompt to Claude to begin coding of the text to speech:


We will now start working on a "text to speech" module that will be used to take the text output generated by the LLM via the "llf chat" command and convert it to audio speech.  Thus as the text generated from the LLM is printed on the screen, it will be ran through the "text to speech" module so you can hear it on the computer speakers.  The following are the initial guidelines for the development:

  - All the code for the "text to speech" module will be located in "modules/text2speech"
  - All development should be done in the virtual environment
  - Use the best speech to text Python libraries that would work on a Macbook.
  - Feel free to use the Internet to do any required research, such as which is the best library to use for this project
  - The module should have a simple integration point so it can be used so it could possibly be used with other programs
  - There should be a simple test python script that is created that will do the following
     - The test script should also be located in the "modules/text2speech" directory
     - The test script is standalone and will import the "text to speech" module that you created
     - The test script should accept a command line parameter that enables you to pass text to it
     - The test script will then take the text that is passed to it and process it through the "text to speech" library 
     - The end state of the test script should consist of it having you hear your prompt on the speakers
  - If we need to add some manual configuration files to get this process working for now, that is fine

The future end state that is out of scope for this current work is as follows:

  - The "llf module" command will be used to do the following:
     - list of the modules located in the "modules" directory via the "llf module list" command
     - list of the modules that are currently enabled via the "llf module list --enabled" command
     - enable the module via the "llf module enable text2speech" command
        - When enabled, then when you are in an interactive chat with the LLM via the "llf chat" command then all the text that is generated by the LLM will be converted to audio via the "text2speech" module
     - disable the module via the "llf module disable text2speech" command
        - When disabled, then the module will not be used to process text to speech when using the "llf chat" command
     - print information about a module based on information stored in a JSON file located in "modules" via the "llf module info text2speech" command
     - AN IDEA:  You may want to consider having a module JSON file located in the modules directory that will track the following information
        - Information about the individual modules
        - directory that modules are in
        - if the module is enabled or disabled
        - then when you run a command like "llf chat", it can look in the JSON file to determine which modules to use
        - If applicable, configuration information can reside in the JSON config file

I passed the following prompt to ChatGTP to generate a Product
Requirement Document (PRD):

Help me make a Production Requirements Document (PRD) for an app that
I will vide code with Claude Code.  I am going to build a very flexible
LLM Framework that enables you to run an LLM locally on your local 
computer hardware to enable for the ultimate LLM flexibility without 
having to worry about token costs for executing third party API's for 
LLM access.  The following bullets are the objectives and guidelines 
centered around the application.

Program Name:  Local LLM Framework (LLF)
Program Purpose:  Help run LLM's local on your computer while enabling different 
                  methods to acces it.  The first method to focus on will be 
                  via the CLI. 
Programming Language:  Python
LLM Runtime:  vllm

Libraries:  Choose the best libraries for the specific tasks and needs.
            If there are multiple libraries that can perform the task,
            then you are allowed to consult the Internet to best determine
            which library to pick
Testing:  All code should have Unit Tests defined with a minimum goal of
          80% code coverage
Installation:  Track all required libraries in a requirements.txt file
               that can be installed via the pip command
Documentation:  Provide documentation on how to install, configure ( if
                appliable ), play, and uninstall the game

High Level Steps:
   - Come up with method to download an LLM locally
      - Will want to download the following LLM:  Qwen3-Coder
   - Provide a CLI method to access the LLM to send and receive requests
     to the LLM
   - Determine proper architecture to use ( pick one below )
      - Write python code to run the LLM as a service process locally and
        have the user run a small client that sends and receives requests
        to the LLM running as a service
      - Write a single python program that that takes input from the user
        and executes the LLM to generate a response all in the same program

Before making any architectural decisions, note that the following funcationality
is going to be developed in the future, but is considered out of scope for
this part of development:
   - Enable the use of different LLM's via a configuration file
      - This enables the ability to download multiple LLM's and use a 
        configuration file to control which LLM the app is using / pointing to
   - Options for Users to call/execute the LLM 
      - Enhance existing CLI 
      - Through a GUI interface
      - Via an API call
   - Additional functionality via modules you can enable and disable
      - Enable functionality to "hear" and "talk to" the LLM
         - Text to Audio functionality to convert LLM text responses to 
           audio for the end user to hear
         - Audio to Text funcationality to convert the end user input from 
           their voice to text to send to the LLM
   - Additional functionality via tools you can enable and disable
      - Ability to run commands locally on the computer
         - Define what commands the LLM can execute via a configuration file
      - Ability to create, read, update, and delete files
         - Define what directories the LLM can access to create, read, update,
           and delete files in along with their sub-directories
         - This will be critical to use the LLM for coding
      - Ability to access the Internet to access data

Additional Notes:  
   - Since vllm provides OpenAI compatible API's, we can use OpenAI Python
     libraries to access the LLM

You can ask me any needed questions to help think through the application
to full y build out the PRD document.  Provide the PRD document in a form
that I can simply copy from here and paste into Claude Code for coding.

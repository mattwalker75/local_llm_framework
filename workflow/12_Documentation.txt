I passed the following prompt to Claude to do some initial documentation:

We need to create some end user mark down (.md) documention.

Update the following user documentation:  docs/HOW_TOs/Setup_Memory.md

This will focus on how to use the "Memory" functionality of the application, which includes the following:
- What the memory functionality provides
- How to use the memory functionality with the "bin/llf memory" set of commands
- How to create new memory modules with the "bin/tools/create_memory.py" script
- The location of the memory modules are in the "memory" directory.
- There is a memory module registry located in "memory/memory_registry.json" which contains data that makes the "bin/llf memory" command aware of the memory modules

You will want to perform the following preperation before creating the mark down end user documentation:
- Review the whole code base
- Review the "bin/llf memory -h", which is the help documentation focused on memory modules
- Review the "bin/tools/create_memory.py" tool

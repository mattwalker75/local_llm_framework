I passed the following prompt to Claude to begin coding a simple tools script to create memory modules:

We need a simple program to create new memory data directory and file structures that the LLM can enable and disable via the "llf memory" command set.  

Create the program and put it in the following location:  local_llm_framework/bin/tools

The program should support the following:

- Create a "blank" directory structure in the "memory" directory and it should contain the following files ready to be enabled vai the "llf memory" command
     - index.json
     - memory.jsonl
     - metadata.json
     - README.md

- Please review the following directory for an example:  memory/main_memory

- The README.md can say the exact same thing as the memory/main_memory/README.md file

- This script should NOT copy files from the memory/main_memory directory because it needs to be able to be used to create the memory/main_memory if it does not exist

- The script should accept 1 parameter.  That parameter will be the name of the directory that is created in the "memory" directory.  It will create that directory and the files in there.

- This should be a stand alone script, similar to what you can see in the other scripts in the "tools" directory

- Add the entry to the "main_memory/memory_registry.json" and print out a statement saying how the fields were given default values that should be reviewd and edited accordingly

- Please write it in Python

- We do NOT need any unit tests written for it.  

- Add a pytest ignore for all files under bin/tools.    Those are small stand alone scripts that do not need any unit tests and do not need to be marked against us from a unit testing perspective due to lack of code coverage

- Do not worry about adding any .md documentation.  I will take care of that.

- Please review the code base to better understand my need and ask any questions that are needed prior ot starting

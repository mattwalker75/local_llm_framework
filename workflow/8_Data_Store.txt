I passed the following prompt to Claude to begin coding of the data store management code:


We will now start working on a RAG data store management system utilizing the "llf datastore" command.  We will be using a lot of the same concepts that the "llf module" command uses.  For example, the "llf module" command uses a "module_registry.json" file to collect information about the modules and determine if the are enabled or disabled via the "enabled" parameter within the file.  We will be doing something very similar with a file called "data_store_registery.json".  Except with the "data_store_registery.json", we will be using "attached" instead of "enabled".

High level functionality:

We will want to dynamically attach and detach RAG data stores that are "attached" to the LLM for use.  If a data store is 
disabled then it will not be included as a data source for the LLM to search.  If a data store is attached then it will be
included as a RAG data source for the LLM to search for information.  The creation and management of the RAG data stores will
be handled outside of the system so the only thing to reference and use is the "data_store_registery.json" file.

File and data location:

  - For reference, the module data is located here:  modules
  - For reference, the module registery is located here:  modules/modules_registry.json
  - For reference, review the code for "llf module <COMMAND>"
  - All the data stores, will be located here:  data_stores
  - The data store registery is located here:  data_stores/data_store_registry.json
     - The data_store_registry.json is already built and and is ready to use

Focusing on the data_store_registry.json and how it is used:

  - All data stores are located in the following:  data_stores: [ ]
  - The following are required parameters:
     - name
     - display_name
     - description
     - attached
     - vector_store_path
     - embedding_model
     - embedding_dimension
     - index_type
  - The following are optional parameters and should have a default if they are not set:
     - model_cache_dir
     - top_k_results
     - similarity_threshold
     - max_context_length
     - created_date
     - num_vectors
     - metadata  

Current in scope items:
  - Listing state of the data stores:
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore list
         - Displays the "display_name" of the data store and its "attached" state
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore list --attached
         - Same as "llf datastore list" but only show data stores that have "attached" set to "true"
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore attach DATASTORE_NAME
         - This will update the "attached" field for the data store to "true"
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore attach all
         - This will update the "attached" field for all the data stores to "true"
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore detach DATASTORE_NAME
         - This will update the "attached" field for the data store to "false"
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore detach all
         - This will update the "attached" field for all the data stores to "false"
     - COMMAND:  llf datastore info DATASTORE_NAME
         - This will print out the following information about the datastore
            - display_name (name) 
            - description
            - location of RAG datastore ( this can be obtained from vector_store_path ) 
  - Remember to update online documentation:  "llf -h" and "llf datastore -h"
  - Add unit tests for the additional functionality
     - Remember to use the "llf_venv" virtual environment when doing testing

Current out of scope items:
  - incorporating the RAG data stores to be used by the LLM
